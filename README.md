# EDecora
EDecora is a web application for the users who wants to order decoration items via online to decorate their house, offices, etc.
In this application first we have Login activity. In Login page we have 2 options of Google and email Login and Sign UP.
After creating account and login there is a main activity which have some UI with my Profile, cart & Logout button.
In profile activity user can add their information such as address and email which will be use for delivery. 
Once user save information the info will be added into Firebase database.
Behind the main activity i have some other activities which have decoration items with their price. If user wants to purchase any item then user can add item from there and that item will be added to the cart.
In cart activity they can see all added items with the total price.
From there they can checkout from the cart and that will take users to the order summary activity. That shows total price and expected delivery date with order summary.
In the main activity I have logout button. If user selected logout then it redirects to login page.
